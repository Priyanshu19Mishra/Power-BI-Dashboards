# Power-BI-Dashboards
Power BI is a powerful business analytics service developed by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence (BI) capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. It allows users to connect to multiple data sources, transform and analyze data, and visualize it through a wide variety of charts, graphs, and other data visualizations.

Overview of Power BI: 
Power BI was designed to help businesses make sense of their data by turning it into actionable insights. Itâ€™s part of the larger Microsoft Power Platform, which includes tools for automating workflows (Power Automate) and building applications (Power Apps).

Power BI is widely used in industries ranging from finance and retail to healthcare and manufacturing for tracking performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.

Components of Power BI: 
Power BI consists of several tools and services, which include:

a. Power BI Desktop
This is a Windows-based application that allows users to create reports and dashboards. It is the primary tool for data modeling, visualization, and report generation. Users can import data from various sources (Excel, databases, cloud services, etc.), clean and transform the data, and build complex data models.
b. Power BI Service (Power BI Online)
The cloud-based service where users can publish, share, and collaborate on Power BI reports. It allows users to create dashboards by combining multiple reports and sharing them with others in the organization. It supports real-time data access and interactive dashboards.
c. Power BI Mobile
Power BI provides mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows devices, allowing users to view reports and dashboards on the go. The mobile app is particularly useful for executives and managers who need access to data anywhere.
d. Power BI Gateway
A gateway acts as a bridge between on-premises data (data that resides in local servers) and Power BI service. It allows secure data transfer between local servers and the cloud service.
e. Power BI Embedded
Power BI Embedded allows developers to embed Power BI reports and dashboards into their applications. It is commonly used to provide analytics and visualization features in custom applications without requiring end-users to have a Power BI account.
f. Power BI Report Server
A special type of server that allows hosting Power BI reports on-premises. It is useful for organizations that need to keep their data within their internal network for security or compliance reasons.
g. Power Query and Power Pivot
Power Query is used for data transformation and preparation, allowing users to clean and shape the data.
Power Pivot is used for advanced data modeling, enabling users to create relationships between tables and use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas for complex calculations.
