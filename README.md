# Power-BI-Dashboards
Power BI is a powerful business analytics service developed by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence (BI) capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. It allows users to connect to multiple data sources, transform and analyze data, and visualize it through a wide variety of charts, graphs, and other data visualizations.

Overview of Power BI: 
Power BI was designed to help businesses make sense of their data by turning it into actionable insights. Itâ€™s part of the larger Microsoft Power Platform, which includes tools for automating workflows (Power Automate) and building applications (Power Apps).

Power BI is widely used in industries ranging from finance and retail to healthcare and manufacturing for tracking performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.

Components of Power BI: 
Power BI consists of several tools and services, which include:

a. Power BI Desktop This is a Windows-based application that allows users to create reports and dashboards. It is the primary tool for data modeling, visualization, and report generation. Users can import data from various sources (Excel, databases, cloud services, etc.), clean and transform the data, and build complex data models.

b. Power BI Service (Power BI Online):  The cloud-based service where users can publish, share, and collaborate on Power BI reports. It allows users to create dashboards by combining multiple reports and sharing them with others in the organization. It supports real-time data access and interactive dashboards.

c. Power BI Mobile
Power BI provides mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows devices, allowing users to view reports and dashboards on the go. The mobile app is particularly useful for executives and managers who need access to data anywhere.

d. Power BI Gateway :A gateway acts as a bridge between on-premises data (data that resides in local servers) and Power BI service. It allows secure data transfer between local servers and the cloud service.

e. Power BI Embedded:  Power BI Embedded allows developers to embed Power BI reports and dashboards into their applications. It is commonly used to provide analytics and visualization features in custom applications without requiring end-users to have a Power BI account.

f. Power BI Report Server : A special type of server that allows hosting Power BI reports on-premises. It is useful for organizations that need to keep their data within their internal network for security or compliance reasons.

g. Power Query and Power Pivot : Power Query is used for data transformation and preparation, allowing users to clean and shape the data.
Power Pivot is used for advanced data modeling, enabling users to create relationships between tables and use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas for complex calculations.

A Power BI dashboard is a single-page, visual representation of key metrics, reports, and data insights. It provides a high-level overview of important information by aggregating data from various sources, allowing users to monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions. Unlike Power BI reports, which can have multiple pages and detailed data visualizations, a dashboard is focused on displaying the most critical data in a concise and interactive manner.

Tiles: Tiles are the individual visual components on the dashboard. Each tile represents a visualization, such as a chart, graph, KPI, or card, and can be pinned from a report. Users can click on these tiles to drill down into the underlying reports for more detailed analysis.

Interactive Visuals:Power BI dashboards offer interactive visuals that are automatically updated when the data source is refreshed. Users can interact with the tiles to explore data and gain insights. For example, clicking on a visual may filter or highlight related data across other visuals in the report.

Data Sources: Power BI dashboards aggregate data from a variety of sources, including databases (SQL Server, MySQL), cloud services (Azure, Google Analytics), files (Excel, CSV), APIs, and live streaming data. This flexibility allows you to visualize data from multiple platforms in one place.

Real-time Data:Power BI dashboards support real-time data streaming, allowing you to see data changes as they happen. This is useful for scenarios like monitoring IoT devices, social media trends, or live sales data.

KPI and Metrics: Dashboards allow you to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics by displaying data like sales targets, financials, or customer engagement in real time. Users can create KPI tiles that display how a specific value compares to a goal.

Customization: Power BI dashboards can be customized according to users' preferences. You can change the layout, resize visuals, and modify the theme. Additionally, users can adjust data filters and slicers to view different subsets of the data.

Mobile Accessibility: Power BI offers a mobile app (available on iOS, Android, and Windows) that allows users to view and interact with dashboards on the go. The dashboards are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

Natural Language Queries: Power BI dashboards support Q&A features, allowing users to type natural language questions to explore the data (e.g., "What were the sales last quarter?" or "Show sales by region"). Power BI will generate visualizations based on the queries.

Sharing and Collaboration: Dashboards can be shared across teams or with specific users in Power BI by publishing them to a workspace. Shared users can view and interact with the dashboard but may not have permission to modify it unless given access. Power BI Pro or Premium licenses are required for sharing outside of your organization.

Alerts and Notifications: Power BI supports alerts on dashboard tiles, especially for KPIs and metrics. Users can set thresholds for specific data points, and Power BI will notify them via email when certain conditions are met (e.g., sales drop below a set number).

Use Cases for Power BI Dashboards:
Sales Performance Monitoring:
Dashboards can provide an at-a-glance view of sales performance, tracking sales targets, revenue, and customer behavior in real-time.

Operational Insights:
Dashboards can help operations teams monitor processes like inventory levels, order fulfillment, and supply chain metrics, ensuring smooth operations.

Executive Dashboards:
Senior management can use dashboards to visualize critical business metrics such as overall profitability, performance by region, or project status.

Financial Analysis:
Dashboards are frequently used to display financial KPIs, cash flow, and budget tracking, enabling CFOs to make strategic decisions based on the data.

In this repo, different images showing the dashboards has been added.
"Bevarage Sales dashboard" created on a beverage dataset.
"Sales Analysis Dashboard". This is created on the employee dataset with the analysis details of the sale together. 
"Customer Segmentation Dashboard". This is created on the same dataset of sales details.
"Finance Dashboard". This is also created on the finance dataset. 
"Employee Performance Dashboard". This is created on the Employee details dataset. 
All these dashborad designs are very crucial for business analystics. Improving these designs using AI is the next step ahead in this field. Many researches are processing ahead to add varios AI techinques with business analytics to make the task more simpler and appropriate and ease to human cycle. Recent trends are working in the field of connecting NLP in business analytics.
